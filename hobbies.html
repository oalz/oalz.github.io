                    <h4 id="videogames">Video Games</h4>
                      <p class=>Video Games has always been a huge passion of me ever since I was a kid. From building houses in Minecraft to playing shooter games such as Valorant, I can pretty much say I have tried most popular games that are out there. I can also say that I dedicate a huge chunk of my lifestyle to gaming, and consider it more than a hobby, but a way of life for some people, especially myself.</p>
                    <h4 id="programming">Programming</h4>
                      <p>When people usually visit websites or use applications or play some video games, they usually just do it in order to fullfil it's purpose. The purpose of said programs is to satisfy the customer's needs in the way that it is designed. The purpose that I saw from said applications was to show people how diverse programming can actually be. When I was a kid, unlike other kids which got handed video games and applications to use, I was actually fascinated by the way the applications worked and the design that was used and the only question that popped into my mind was: How was this application or game built? So I decided to learn programming in order to better understand how the digital world works nowadays.</p>
                    <h4 id="travelling">Travelling</h4>
                      <p>My parents would take yearly trips everytime school ended. In every trip, I would of course accompany my parents in all their trips, and with all the places that we have travelled to, it has definetly given me a sense of joy and excitement everytime I travelled as it got me excited to see how people in totally different countries live and how their customs and way of living differed from the way that I, alongside many others in my country, live.</p>
                    <h4 id="cards">Playing Cards</h4>
                      <p>Since I was a kid, I used to watch my dad play with his friends a famous Jordanian card game called Trix Complex. I used to be extremely fascinated by it and then started learning it with my friends, as their fathers used to also play the game. Since then, a hobby which turned to an addiction for our parents was passed on to us, as we became immersed and in love with the game. We then started learning other card games such as Tarneeb, another famous Arab card game, as well as Baloot, a famous Saudi card game played by many people.</p>
